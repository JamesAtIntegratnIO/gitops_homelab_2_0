# Promise definitions directory

This directory contains Kratix promise definitions that extend the platform.

Promises are automatically deployed by the kratix-promises ApplicationSet.

## Security Requirements

ALL promise pipelines MUST use ExternalSecret resources for credentials.
NEVER create plain Secret objects - the pre-commit hook will block them.

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for safe patterns.
